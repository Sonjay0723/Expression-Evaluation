# Expression-Evaluation
A program that takes a mathematical expression with the basic operators and parenthesized subexpressions, solves it, and returns a double value using stacks and recurssion.
It can also substitute in values based on a variable or an array of values once given in a text file.
The parts of the project I worked on was the body of the makeVariableLists and evaluate methods.
